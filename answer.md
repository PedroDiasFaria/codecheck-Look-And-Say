It's all explained in the code.
I knew numberphile would help me someday. Already saw them talking about this sequence in 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea7lJkEhytA 

Basically using a recursive approach, every iteration I check all the terms of the previous solution
Then make a counting whenever each term is repeated in sequence, append it to the solution for the next iteration and continue until the last one.
